        <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
        <text>I co-developed a blockchain gaming platform, enhancing gaming experiences with secure cryptocurrency transactions.
             My proficiency in React.js and Web3.js ensures fluid front-end functionality, while my Solidity smart contracts provide a robust framework for transparent in-game economics.
              Leveraging Agile principles, I prioritize effective collaboration and on-time delivery. 
              From designing Java-based file systems to automating eCommerce arbitrage between Walmart and eBay, my projects stand as testaments to my versatility and dedication
               to back-end innovation and forward-thinking development strategies.
