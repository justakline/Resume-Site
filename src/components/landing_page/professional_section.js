            <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
            <text>Crafting efficient solutions and streamlining user experiences on the Ethereum blockchain, 
                Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a knack for revitalizing learning in computer science. 
                At Towson University, I rejuvenated tutoring methods, enhancing student understanding of key programming concepts. 
                My hands-on development role at Stake Game led to a 45% surge in user engagement, thanks to my integration of user-friendly features and smart contract expertise. 
                Committed to robust and secure DeFi operations, I employ test-driven development and CI/CD practices to consistently deliver quality and adapt to feedback.
